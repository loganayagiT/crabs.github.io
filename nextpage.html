        <h4>hello sunshines!!! so i am taking this moment to appritiate you , for who you are. i hope you find what youre searching for out there. i hope you find the kind of happiness that exist on your own terms.that kind of love that believes in you and supports you, that stands by your side.I hope you truly take the time to figure out what moves you, that cherishes your soul , what you deeply desire for in your life. I hope you have the courage to chase that.I hope you find the kind of love that makes you a softer person.You deserve all the good things and a beautiful life even though you have to deal with all the sucking things that come into your life. One day, in an unexpected way of time, you will get the beautiful thing of life in the middle of this mess.I hope you find acceptance.You're always good enough.I hope you forgive yourself for the mistakes you have made,for the past you keep alive inside of you.I hope you learn to let go of the things you had to do in order to heal or to lead a healthy life. I hope you surround youreslf with the kinds of friends that encourage you, and the ones who are always there for you. 
No matter what happens or how bad it seems today,life does go on,and it will be better tomorrow.You are going to find the things that make you feel free in life.You are going to discover the things that fill you with purpose,the things that make you want to rise ever morning.You do not have to have all of the answers right now. You do not have to sort all out right here.It will absoluetly feel that way, but at the same time, this is true, as the world moves around you, the ground is steady beneath your feet.You have come a long way and have been through so much.I hope 19 treats you better than 18 did. I wish you nothing but more years.I'll always pray to god to continue blessing you with bigger and bigger things in your life cause you deserve that, and i wish to spend more upcoming birthdays with you.I am completely proud of what you are achieving , little by little I am very happy to see you progressing and accomplishing your goals by working day by day. I am proud to see how you got up from that fall. I know it hurt but I am very proud of how you are recovering , step by step the wound will stop hurting and then there will only be a small scar that will remind you that you are strong and that you have already gone through this, nothing can stop you now . You are worthy of the same love you give. you bring value when you show up others , and also, when you breathe Deep and simply live . you long to find your place in the world . you long to fully present . and I just hope that just as much as you are present to others you are present yourself . you see beauty in the life of others and the stories that they tell and I hope you know as you listen you are worthy of being heard as well . you love other so well you see where light force through may you find the same love you give you you are worthy of recieving too.I hope you're doing well. I hope even in the most of every pain, difficulty, and chaos you are committing yourselves to be a little more kind and gentle with your heart. I know life can be more than difficult sometimes, but I hope you are finding the strength to keep on going even on those days. I hope things are changing for you and you are starting to see the purpose and the good in all that you have been through.It is okay to take your time. We live in a generation that romanticizes moving forward as quickly as possible when it comes to career and our futures and our success within them. But there is no point in rushing quickly towards a life that will not impress you or fulfill you. It is okay to slow down. It is okay to take the time you need. You are in no rush to figure out your own soul. It's never too late to start over. It's never too late to change your mind. It's never too late to redirect yourself to replace the dreams you thought you wanted for the ones that genuinely excite and challenge you.Just leap towards all these scars and try something while you are here already.I hope you know you are loved. I hope things get simple for you. Peaceful. Spend your days with easy breaths and soft words. You deserve life through Windowshell. I hope it comes your way soon.
                                                 HAPPY BIRTHDAY CRABS<3</h4>
